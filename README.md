# Informaticon PBNI Framework
Libraries for creating PowerBuilder Extensions using PowerBuilder Native Interface (PBNI).

[![Tests](https://github.com/informaticon/lib.cpp.base.pbni-framework/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/informaticon/lib.cpp.base.pbni-framework/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

## Runtime dependencies
 - [Informaticon Exception Framework](https://github.com/informaticon/lib.pb.base.exception-framework)
 - Microsoft Visual C++

## Usage
If you are creating a new project, you can use this [template repository](https://github.com/informaticon/div.cpp.base.pbni-extension-template).
You can find some (partially outdated) examples over [there](https://github.com/informaticon/div.cpp.base.pbni-framework-usage-example).

To check how to create classes and export functions, you can also check out one of these repositories (only available to Informaticon employees):
 - [lib.pbni.base.tse](https://github.com/informaticon/lib.pbni.base.tse)
 - [lib.pbni.base.string-utils](https://github.com/informaticon/lib.pbni.base.string-utils)
 - [lib.pbni.base.pepper](https://github.com/informaticon/lib.pbni.base.pepper)
 - [lib.pbni.base.mail-client](https://github.com/informaticon/lib.pbni.base.mail-client)
 - [lib.pbni.base.libcurl](https://github.com/informaticon/lib.pbni.base.libcurl)
 - [lib.pbni.base.serializer](https://github.com/informaticon/lib.pbni.base.serializer)
 - [lib.pbni.base.graphics-utils](https://github.com/informaticon/lib.pbni.base.graphics-utils)

## x64
Now works for x64 Builds. Things to consider:
 - `longptr` isn't natively supported by PBNI. But the PBNI Framework offers a `FakePBLongPtr`, which is just a `PBLong` in Win32 Builds and `PBLonglong` in x64 Builds.
 - The Editor doesn't yet support x64. So during development you need to use the Win32 Version of the PBNI Dll's, then you only use the x64 Builds when you ship your 64-bit Application.

## Documentation
This repository uses Doxygen and MKDocs for documentation.
You may need to have the following software to build/view the documentation:
* [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl) (on Windows: `choco install doxygen`)
* [Doxybook2](https://github.com/matusnovak/doxybook2) (on Windows: `choco install doxybook2`)
* [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) (install it with `pip install mkdocs`)
* On Windows you have to manually install make (`choco install make`)

To generate and view the documentation locally, run `make` and `make serve`.
This will create and open a Web documentation on `localhost:8000`.

> [!TIP]
> You can also check out the pre-compiled documentation on Github instead:
> https://github.com/informaticon/lib.cpp.base.pbni-framework/blob/main/docs/index.md.

If you want regenerate the documentation for Github, you have to run `make doxygen` and `make doxybook-git` before committing.

## How to build
This is a cpp library, you only have to build it for testing purposes, otherwise you use it in your C++ project (see PBNI Template).

### Requirements

- PowerBuilder PBNI Library
- CMake ([direct download](https://cmake.org/download/) or via [choco](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cmake))
- * Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools (e.g. from [MS Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/community/))
- vcpkg (to get these libraries):
  - boost-stacktrace
  - boost-utility
  - boost-multiprecision

### Tests
Build the test dll by running
```ps1
conan build .\test\cpp\ -pr pbni_x86 -b missing -o *:pb_version=22.0
```

Run tests by doing
```ps1
make -C test/pb tests
```
