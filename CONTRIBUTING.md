# How to contribute

**If you send us code via a pull request, we assume it is licensed under the MIT license.**
We are open for feedback and we value suggestions.

## Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request to the main branch with a clear list of what you've done and what you'd like to achieve with the change.

Always write a clear log message for your commits.

## Code Formatting
We provide a `.clang-format` file, if you have `clang-format (>= v17)` installed you can run `make format` in the root directory.
